# API
This chapter is an introduction to the eduvpn-common API. It is meant as a high-level overview on how to use API and build your own eduVPN/Let's Connect! client. In this chapter, we *go* over the basics of how the interop between Go and language x works, say something about the architecture, explain where to find detailed API documentation, give a typical flow for a client and give a follow along tutorial on building an eduVPN client using Python code.
